# A Pretty Heckin' Website 
## An Exploration of Best Practices in Web Design  

A Pretty Heckin' Website is a minimalist website concerned with modeling HTML elements to create a 'blog' type theme.  The document itself discusses several HTML concepts, while the styling is meant to convey general visual concepts the user should keep in mind as they build a webpage.  Beyond serving as a slightly snarky best practices sheet, A Pretty Heckin' Website also can be used as a template to apply other CSS designs owning to the very minimalist styling used.

### Inspiration
This is inspired by several sites with very coarse language, [M***** F****** Website](http://motherfuckingwebsite.com), [Better M***** F****** Website](http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com) and [The Best M***** F****** Website](https://thebestmotherfucking.website/).  While the language and section headings leave much to be desired, these provided a good basis for the thought experiment I built with A Pretty Heckin' Website.

### Criticism
Did I fudge up?  Create an issue and make me learn my lesson.  No seriously, this is a learning exercise.
