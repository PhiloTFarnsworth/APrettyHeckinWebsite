# A Pretty Heckin' Website 
## A Post-Ironic Statement on Web Design

A Pretty heckin' website is designed to be a lightweight single page static website that offers some thoughts on design and is maybe kinda funny.  The real goal is to come up with a small set of css declarations that cover many real world design issues when styling basic html structures, while having some filler content that is not lorem ipsum.  It is also an opportunity to focus a bit more on topics like accessibility and model the necessary attributes for a modern user friendly website. 

This is inspired by several sites with very coarse language, so prepare yourself should you follow this link [The Best M***** F****** Website](https://thebestmotherfucking.website/).
