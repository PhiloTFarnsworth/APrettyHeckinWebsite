		<h2>Why Another Heckin' Website?</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				In deference to the great luminaries of the past, we should expect more from websites that purport
				to be the best {expletive} website. A Pretty Heckin' website meekly submits that beyond making your
				site small, maybe you could think about accessibility and if it's not too much a bother maybe don't just use
				a more than like, 5 bullet points in a row.
			</p>
		</div>
		<h3>Section Headings Aren't For Emphasis: A Modest Proposal</h3>
		<div>
			<p>
				I don't want to disagree with such strongly worded convictions of our sainted forefathers, but when
				writing a humble static site using headers in a way that clues the reader in on what's about to be
				discussed. Not only will using relevant headers help your readers follow the content of your page,
				but it might stop you from I don't know, using 14 bullet points in a row on some tangentially related
				topics. That of course, leads me to...
			</p>
			<aside>
				<h4>Fun Tip</h4>
				<p>
					An aside can be better place to deliver rebukes to your reader's intelligence. The goal of your
					website is to prove how intelligent you are, not how homely the reader is.
				</p>
			</aside>
		</div>
		<h3>There's More to Life than Lists</h3>
		<div>
			<p>
				Variety is the spice of life, and in that vein, you should consider breaking up information when it makes
				sense.
			</p>
		</div>
		<h4>Tables</h4>
		<table>
			<caption>Tables Are Great for Comparisons</caption>
			<thead>
				<tr>
					<th>Websites</th>
					<th>Requests Size (Chrome)</th>
					<th>Media?</th>
					<th>Tables?</th>
					<th>Forms?</th>
				</tr>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>Google.com</td>
					<td>~800 kB</td>
					<td>N/A</td>
					<td>N/A</td>
					<td>YES</td>

				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>
		<h4>Lists</h4>
		<div>
		<p>
			Okay, I kinda lied, because beyond comparisons you're gonna need lists, but you should 
			make an effort at organizing it.  If you have over 5 points, consider refactoring, or at 
			least organizing with sub lists.  
		</p>
		
			<aside>
				<h5>Numbered Lists</h5>
				<p>What? Are you writing a table of contents?</p>
			</aside>
		</div>
			<ul>
				<li>My superior CSS</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Lightweight</li>
					<ul>
						<li>under 250 lines</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Responsive</li>
					<ul><li>Broadly compatible</li></ul>
					<li>Built with Sass</li>
				</ul>
				<li>My Honorable HTML</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Semantic</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Headings <strong>aren't</strong> used for emphasis</li>
						<li>Built for default accessibility</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Comprehensive</li>
					<ul>
						<li>HTML features like forms and tables</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
				<li>My Judicious Javascript</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Important data loads without it</li>
					<li>Provides interesting, optional features</li>
				</ul>
				<li>More general features</li>
			</ul>
		<p>Even then, you can get wild and use some more exotic representations built right into the HTML spec</p>
		<h4>Other Informational Widgets</h4>
		<div>
			<p>
				It's the year 2022, so we can also start to enjoy some newer widgets, like details and meter.
				If you don't think a comment merits an aside, details<sup>1</sup> makes a convenient footnote
				tag while meter is a built-in progress bar. These are definitely more contextual for usage,
				but using both might be better than an additional 10 mB in your node-modules folder.
			</p>
			<aside>
				<h5>Internet Explorer</h5>
				<p>One day MDN will not be filled with warnings about Internet Explorer.  Until then, try to build important stuff without these elements.</p>
			</aside>
		</div>
		<h5>Details</h5>

		<details>
			<summary>Footnote: 1</summary>
			<p>You can use details when you don't think it's necessary for the reader to get all the details.</p>
		</details>
		<h5>Meter</h5>
		<div>
			<label class="freeLabel" for="pageProgress">Page Progress:</label>
			<meter id="pageProgress" min="0" max="100" value="0" optimum="0">
				0
			</meter>
			<p>This bar measures your progress on the page</p>
			<!-- TODO: UPDATE THIS WITH CURRENT SCROLL POSITION -->
		</div>
		</div>
		<h3>Forms are Fundamental</h3>
		<div>
			<p>
				It's certainly weird that we're writing about websites that don't offer anything to do. Since you already have
				a livejournal, we should probably model what you do when you want to have a website that actually does
				something.
			</p>
			<form>
				<fieldset>
					<legend>Just a Form</legend>
					<label for="formText">Text Input</label>
					<input type="text" id="formText" name="text" placeholder="Type Something, Will ya?">
					<label for="formNumber">Number Input</label>
					<input type="number" id="formNumber" name="number" min="0" max="100">
					<label for="formRange">Range Input</label>
					<input type="range" id="formRange" name="range" min="0" max="100">
					<label for="formDate">Date Time Input</label>
					<input type="datetime-local" id="formDate" name="date">
					<label for="formBoxes">Checkboxes</label>
					<fieldset id="formBoxes">
						<label for="formBoxYes">YES</label>
						<input type="checkbox" id="formBoxYes" name="box" value="YES" checked>
						<label for="FormBoxNo">NO</label>
						<input type="checkbox" id="formBoxNo" name="box" value="NO">
					</fieldset>
					<label for="formSelect">Select</label>
					<select id="formSelect" name="select">
						<option value=""></option>
						<option value="1xer">1Xer</option>
						<option value="10xer">10Xer</option>
						<option value="overflow xer">Overflow Xer</option>
					</select>
					<button>Submit Form</button>
				</fieldset>
			</form>
			<!-- TODO: FORM SHOULD CREATE AN ALERT WITH VALUES CHOSEN, RANGE AND NUMBER SHOULD AFFECT THE SAME VALUE AND MOVE A METER. -->
			<p>
				Now we're talking, there's even a button on the site now. Instead of venting to the world, you've now shown you
				can take input and throw it right back in the user's face, where it belongs.
			</p>
		</div>
		<h3>Images and other pretty things</h3>
		<div>
			<aside>
				<h4>Napoleon Dynamite Sez</h4>
				<img src="Heckin.jpg" alt="Napoleon Dynamite"></img>
				<p>Maybe Best Friggin' Website is more on brand?</p>
			</aside>
			<p>
				Finally, you need to accommodate your users who go by pictures, this is not always an easy task.
				And to be honest, you should probably prepare for the only lower form of life, people who watch tutorials on
				youtube.
			</p>
		</div>
		<p>What's that you say?</p>
			<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RzX-fx_GhrM"
				title="YouTube video player - Harrison Ford Already Works Around the Clock" frameborder="0"
				allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"
				allowfullscreen></iframe>
			<p>
				Even accounting for the tables and forms, we're still looking at less than 250 lines of CSS.  Don't believe me?
				check out what this quote has to say about it:  
			</p>
				<figure>
					<blockquote>
						<p>I didn't kill my wife! Also something about web design!</p>
					</blockquote>
					<figcaption>- Dr. Richard Kimble, <cite>Seeking the One Armed Man</cite></figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>That's right, we should keep all this in mind as we approach web design.</p>
		<h2>Pretty Heckin' Website is not a satire</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				Every website should look like this, and any which do not conform should be removed from the internet with
				extreme prejudice.
			</p>
		</div>
		<h2>Epilogue</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				Inspired by the brilliant pages <a href="https://thebestmotherfucking.website/">The Best M*****F******
					Website</a>,
				<a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/">Better M*****F****** Website</a> and <a
					href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">M*****F****** Website</a>.
				Beyond being entertaining reads, they offer some sage advice about webpage design. Even if they have never heard
				of a table.
