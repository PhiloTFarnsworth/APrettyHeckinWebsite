        <h2>Why Another Heckin' Website?</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                In deference to the great luminaries of the past, we should expect more from websites that purport 
                to be the best {expletive} website.  A Pretty Heckin' website meekly submits that beyond making your 
                site small, maybe you could think about accessibility and if it's not too much a bother maybe don't just use 
                a more than like, 5 bullet points in a row.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
        <h3>Section Headings Aren't For Emphasis: A Modest Proposal</h3>
        <p>
            I don't want to disagree with such strongly worded convictions of our sainted forefathers, but when
            writing a humble static site using headers in a way that clues the reader in on what's about to be 
            discussed.  Not only will using relevant headers help your readers follow the content of your page, 
            but it might stop you from I don't know, using 14 bulletpoints in a row on some tangetically related 
            topics.  That of course, leads me to...
        </p>
        <aside>
            <h4>Fun Tip</h4>
            <p>
                An aside can be better place to deliver rebukes to your reader's intelligence.  The goal of your 
                website is to prove how intelligent you are, not how slovenly and homely the reader reading this is.
            </p>

        <div>
        <h3>There's More to Life than Lists</h3>
        <p>
            Variety is the spice of life, and in that vein, you should consider breaking up information when it makes
            sense.
        </p>
        <div>
        <h4>Tables</h4>
        <table>
            <caption>Tables Are Great for Comparisons</caption>

            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>With that said... Lists are actually important</p>
        </div>
        <div>
        <h4>Lists</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>But you want to keep list items short</li>
            <li>They should also be to the point</li>
            <li>You shouldn't really write full sentences in them</li>
            <li>But if you do</li>
            <li>You should probably make sure that you're handling longer sentences when building a responsive modern website</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Even then, you can get wild and use some more exotic representations built right into the HTML spec</p>
        </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Other Informational Widgets</h4>
                <p>Since we're past the age of IE, we can also use some more esoteric tags, like Details and Meter</p>
                <details>
                    <summary>Look at this!</summary>
                    <p>You can use details when you don't think it's necessary for the reader to get all the details.</p>
                </details>
                <br></br>

            <h3>Forms are Fundamental</h3>
            <p>
                It's certainly weird that we're writing about websites that don't offer anything to do.  Since you already have
                a livejournal, we should probably model what you do when you want to have a website that actually does something.
            </p>
            <form>
                <fieldset>
                    <label for="formText">Text Input</label>
                    <input type="text" id="formText" name="text" placeholder="Type Something, Will ya?">

            <p>
                Now we're talking, there's even a button on the site now.  Instead of venting to the world, you've now shown you 
                can take input and throw it right back in the user's face, where it belongs.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Images, colors and all those pretty things</h3>
            <p>
                Finally, you need to accommodate your users who go by pictures, this is not always an easy task.
            </p>
            <img src="Heckin.jpg" alt="Some Picture Here"></img>
            <p>
                And to be honest, you should probably prepare for the only lower form of life, people who watch tutorials on youtube.

            <h2>Pretty Heckin Website is not a satire</h2>
            <p>
                Every website should look like this, and any which do not conform should be removed from the internet with extreme prejudice.

                Beyond being entertaining reads, they offer some sage advice about what's important in webpage design.  Even if they have never heard of 
                a table.
